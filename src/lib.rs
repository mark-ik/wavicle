//! wavicle — a pure-Rust WavPack v5 codec.
//!
//! A wavicle is Eddington's word for the quantum entity that is both wave and
//! particle. A lossless codec makes audio exactly that: a continuous wave to
//! the ear, discrete bits on disk, one identity in both observations.
//!
//! Scope: lossless mono/stereo decode and encode of the WavPack v5 stream —
//! 16/24/32-bit integer and bit-exact 32-bit float PCM. Pure Rust, no C,
//! wasm-capable. Out of scope: DSD, hybrid/lossy modes, correction files,
//! more than two channels, pre-4.0 legacy streams.
//!
//! **Status: name claim.** No functionality yet. The founding plan, milestone
//! ladder, and conformance-oracle method live in the repository's
//! `design_docs/`.
